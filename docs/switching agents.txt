‚óè To change your Claude Code model to Sonnet or Opus 4, you can use these commands:

  Change Model Commands

  Switch to Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Latest)

  claude config set model claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022

  Switch to Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Previous)

  claude config set model claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620

  Switch to Claude 3 Opus

  claude config set model claude-3-opus-20240229

  claude config set model claude-3-haiku-20240307

  Check Current Configuration

  claude config list

  Verify Model Change

  claude --version
  claude config get model

  Notes:

  - Sonnet 3.5 is the newest and most capable model (currently what you're using - Sonnet 4)
  - Opus 3 is the most powerful reasoning model but slower
  - Haiku 3 is the fastest but less capable
  - Model changes apply immediately to new conversations
  - Your current conversation will continue with the same model until you start a new session

  The latest Sonnet model (which you're currently using as "Sonnet 4") is typically the best balance of capability and speed for most development tasks.
