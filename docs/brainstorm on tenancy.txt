🤔 Discovery Questions for Sub-Tenant Architecture:

  Let me explore your multi-tenancy needs to understand the best approach:

  🔍 Current Understanding

  Your system has a single-level tenant structure (Tenant → Users). You're considering adding sub-tenants, which would create a hierarchy.

  💡 Key Questions to Shape the Solution:

  1. Business Model Context

  - What's the use case? Are you thinking:
    - 🏢 Franchise model? (Parent company → Individual franchise locations)
    - 🏬 Multi-branch restaurants? (Restaurant chain → Individual branches)
    - 🏨 Hotel chains? (Hotel group → Individual properties)
    - 🤝 Reseller/White-label? (Partner → Their clients)
	
 Answer:🏬 Multi-branch restaurants? (Restaurant chain → Individual branches)
 
  2. Data & Feature Isolation

  - How independent should sub-tenants be?
    - Share parent's menu/pricing or have their own?
    - Separate inventory or shared pool?
    - Independent payment configs or inherit parent's?
    - Own branding or parent branding?
	
 Answer:sub-tenants will their own menu and pricing
		they will have a separate inventory
		they will have separate menu/pricing
		

  3. Administrative Control

  - Who manages what?
    - Can parent tenant admin create/manage sub-tenants?
    - Should sub-tenants have their own admins?
    - Billing - consolidated to parent or separate?
    - Can parent see all sub-tenant data?

  4. Technical Considerations

  - Current constraints?
    - How many sub-tenants per parent expected?
    - Need real-time data aggregation across sub-tenants?
    - Separate domains/subdomains per sub-tenant?

  🎯 Potential Approaches:

  Option A: Hierarchical Tenant Model
  Restaurant Chain (Parent)
  ├── Downtown Branch (Sub-tenant)
  ├── Airport Branch (Sub-tenant)
  └── Mall Branch (Sub-tenant)

  Option B: Shared Resources Model
  Parent Tenant
  ├── Shared: Menu, Pricing, Suppliers
  └── Independent: Orders, Inventory, Staff

  Option C: Franchise Model
  Franchisor
  ├── Franchisee A (Semi-independent)
  └── Franchisee B (Semi-independent)

  📝 What Would Help Me Design This:

  1. Primary goal: Why do you need sub-tenants?
  2. Relationship type: How connected are parent/sub operations?
  3. Scale: How many levels deep? How many sub-tenants?
  4. Critical features: What must be shared vs. separated?

  Quick Example Scenarios:
  - "I run 5 pizza shops under one brand, need separate inventory but shared menu"
  - "I want to let other businesses use my platform under their brand"
  - "I need department-level separation within one restaurant"

  What's your specific scenario? This will help me design the right solution! 🎯
