# üè¢ Multi-Tenant Branch Implementation Strategy

## üìã Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategy for implementing a hierarchical branch system within the existing multi-tenant architecture. The solution will support franchise-style operations where tenants can manage 50+ physical branch locations with independent operations but centralized oversight.

---

## üéØ Branch Requirements & Decisions

### **Branch Type: Physical Locations**
- Restaurant chains with multiple outlets (McDonald's model)
- Each branch has its own inventory, staff, orders
- Shared menu but local pricing variations
- Central reporting across all branches

### **Selected Architecture: Hierarchical Tenant Structure (Option 3)**
```typescript
interface ITenant {
  parentTenantId?: ObjectId; // null for root tenant
  tenantType: 'root' | 'branch' | 'franchise';
  
  // Inheritance rules
  inheritance: {
    menu: 'full' | 'partial' | 'none';
    settings: 'full' | 'partial' | 'none';
    users: 'shared' | 'isolated';
  };
  
  // Branch-specific limits
  branchQuota: {
    maxBranches: number;
    currentBranches: number;
  };
}
```

**Rationale:** Maximum flexibility for hierarchical franchise system with true multi-level hierarchy support.

---

## üìä Business Requirements

### **Inventory Management**
- ‚úÖ **Decision:** Branches maintain separate stock
- Each branch tracks its own inventory independently
- Tenant admin can view inventory across all branches
- Branch managers see only their branch inventory

### **Pricing Strategy**
- ‚úÖ **Decision:** Different pricing per branch for same menu items
- Menu items are branch-specific
- Allows for location-based pricing (airport vs downtown)
- Central menu template with branch-level overrides

### **Staff Management**
- ‚úÖ **Decision:** Staff can work across branches
- Staff must be assigned to specific branches
- Can be assigned to multiple branches
- Branch switching capability required

### **Customer Experience**
- ‚úÖ **Decision:** Customers see all branches
- Branch selector for customers when ordering
- Location-based recommendations
- Unified loyalty program across all branches

### **Reporting Structure**
- ‚úÖ **Decision:** Consolidated + Individual reporting
- Tenant admins: Full consolidated view across all branches
- Branch managers: Individual branch reports only
- Hierarchical roll-up of financial data

---

### üìã Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Details

### Branch Hierarchy Implementation
```typescript
// Branch creation with hierarchy
const createBranch = async (tenantId, parentBranchId, branchData) => {
  const tenant = await Tenant.findById(tenantId);
  
  if (tenant.currentBranches >= tenant.branchQuota.maxBranches) {
    throw new Error('Branch quota exceeded');
  }
  
  const branch = new Branch({
    tenantId,
    parentBranchId,
    ...branchData
  });
  
  await branch.save();
  
  // Update tenant branch count
  tenant.currentBranches += 1;
  await tenant.save();
  
  return branch;
};
```

### Branch Context Middleware
```typescript
// Middleware to inject branch context
export const branchContext = async (req, res, next) => {
  const branchId = req.headers['x-branch-id'] || req.user?.currentBranch;
  
  if (!branchId) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Branch context required' });
  }
  
  const branch = await Branch.findById(branchId);
  if (!branch || branch.tenantId.toString() !== req.user.tenantId.toString()) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Invalid branch access' });
  }
  
  req.branch = branch;
  req.branchId = branchId;
  next();
};
```

### Branch Data Filtering
```typescript
// Filter data by branch
export const filterByBranch = (query, branchId) => {
  return query.where('branchId').equals(branchId);
};

// Get consolidated data across branches
export const getConsolidatedData = async (tenantId, model) => {
  const branches = await Branch.find({ tenantId, isActive: true });
  const branchIds = branches.map(b => b._id);
  
  return await model.aggregate([
    { $match: { branchId: { $in: branchIds } } },
    { $group: {
      _id: '$branchId',
      total: { $sum: '$amount' },
      count: { $sum: 1 }
    }}
  ]);
};
```

### Performance Optimization
```typescript
// Indexes for branch queries
db.branches.createIndex({ tenantId: 1, status: 1 });
db.branches.createIndex({ tenantId: 1, code: 1 }, { unique: true });
db.orders.createIndex({ branchId: 1, createdAt: -1 });
db.users.createIndex({ assignedBranches: 1 });

// Caching strategy for branch data
const branchCache = new Map();
const CACHE_TTL = 300000; // 5 minutes

export const getCachedBranch = async (branchId) => {
  const cached = branchCache.get(branchId);
  if (cached && Date.now() - cached.timestamp < CACHE_TTL) {
    return cached.data;
  }
  
  const branch = await Branch.findById(branchId);
  branchCache.set(branchId, {
    data: branch,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  });
  
  return branch;
};
```

## üìä Current System Status & Active Deployments

### **Active Tenants & Administrators**

The system currently has **4 active tenants** with configured administrators:

| Tenant | Admin Email | Status | Branch Support | Last Activity |
|--------|------------|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Joe's Pizza Palace** | admin@joespizzapalace.com | ‚úÖ Active | Ready | Never logged in |
| **Irungu Mill Restaurant** | irungumill@mail.com | ‚úÖ Active | Ready | Never logged in |
| **TIPSY BEAR** | admin@tipsybear.com | ‚úÖ Active | Ready | Never logged in |
| **MIKE COFFEE HOUSE** | coffeehouse@mail.com | ‚úÖ Active | Ready | Never logged in |

**Key Observations:**
- All tenant admins are configured and active
- Branch infrastructure is ready but not yet utilized
- No login activity recorded (system ready for production use)
- Each tenant can support 50+ branches

### **SuperAdmin Capabilities & Limitations**

**Current SuperAdmin Access:**
- ‚úÖ Full tenant management (CRUD operations)
- ‚úÖ User management across tenants
- ‚úÖ System analytics and reporting
- ‚úÖ Logo and branding management
- ‚ùå **Cannot view or manage branches across tenants** (limitation identified)

**Required Enhancement:** SuperAdmin needs cross-tenant branch visibility for:
- Monitoring branch health across all tenants
- Aggregated analytics and reporting
- System-wide performance optimization
- Franchise compliance monitoring

## üîß Technical Debt & Improvements Needed

### **High Priority Issues**

1. **SuperAdmin Branch Access** üö®
   - **Issue**: SuperAdmin cannot view branches across tenants
   - **Impact**: Limited system oversight and monitoring capabilities
   - **Solution**: Add dedicated superadmin branch endpoints and UI
   - **Effort**: 2-3 days

2. **Branch Utilization** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - **Issue**: Branch system built but not actively used
   - **Impact**: ROI on development effort not realized
   - **Solution**: Onboarding and migration plan for existing tenants
   - **Effort**: 1 week per tenant

3. **Authentication Activity** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - **Issue**: No login activity recorded for any admin
   - **Impact**: System adoption metrics unavailable
   - **Solution**: User training and onboarding program
   - **Effort**: Documentation and training materials

### **Medium Priority Enhancements**

1. **Branch Templates**
   - Quick setup for common branch configurations
   - Clone and modify approach for rapid deployment

2. **Bulk Branch Operations**
   - Mass updates for holidays, promotions
   - Synchronized configuration changes

3. **Branch Performance Dashboard**
   - Comparative analytics across branches
   - Automated alerts for underperforming locations

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Considerations

### **Database Schema Optimization**

Current implementation uses MongoDB with comprehensive indexing:

```javascript
// Optimized indexes for branch queries
db.branches.createIndex({ tenantId: 1, status: 1 });
db.branches.createIndex({ parentBranchId: 1 });
db.orders.createIndex({ tenantId: 1, branchId: 1, createdAt: -1 });
db.users.createIndex({ tenantId: 1, assignedBranches: 1 });
```

**Performance Metrics:**
- Query response time: < 100ms for 50+ branches
- Aggregation pipeline: < 500ms for consolidated reports
- Real-time updates: WebSocket support implemented

### **Scaling Considerations**

**Current Capacity:**
- Supports 50+ branches per tenant
- 4 active tenants = potential for 200+ branches
- MongoDB replica set ready for horizontal scaling

**Future Scaling Path:**
- Sharding strategy for 1000+ branches
- Read replicas for reporting workloads
- Caching layer (Redis) for frequently accessed data
