### 2. Integration Tests
- **Workflow Tests**: End-to-end user journeys (`src/__tests__/integration/`)
- **API Integration**: Real API interaction patterns
- **Cross-component Integration**: Multi-component workflows

### 3. Accessibility Tests

## Test Data Management

### Mock Data Generators
The test suite includes comprehensive mock data generators that create realistic branch data:

- `createMockBranch()`: Individual branch creation
- `createMockBranches()`: Multiple branch creation
- `createMockBranchHierarchy()`: Hierarchical branch structures
- `createMockBranchMetrics()`: Performance metrics
- `branchPresets`: Pre-configured branch types

### API Mocking with MSW
The Mock Service Worker setup provides:
- Realistic API response times
- Error scenario simulation
- Network condition testing
- Request/response validation
- Stateful mock data persistence

### Test Scenarios
Pre-configured scenarios for common testing needs:
- `testScenarios.normal()`: Standard operation
- `testScenarios.slowNetwork()`: Slow connection simulation
- `testScenarios.unreliable()`: Intermittent errors
- `testScenarios.offline()`: Network failure
- `testScenarios.errorProne()`: High error rate

## Best Practices

### 1. Test Organization
- Tests are co-located with source code when possible
- Integration tests are in dedicated directories
- Mock utilities are centralized and reusable

### 2. Test Naming
- Descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Consistent naming conventions across test files
- Clear distinction between unit, integration, and accessibility tests

### 3. Accessibility Testing
- Every UI component has accessibility tests
- Keyboard navigation is verified for all interactive elements
- ARIA attributes and semantic markup are validated
- Screen reader compatibility is ensured

### 4. Error Handling
- All error scenarios are tested
- Network failures and server errors are simulated
- User-facing error messages are validated
- Recovery mechanisms are verified

### 5. Performance
- Loading states are tested
- Large dataset handling is verified
- Concurrent operations are tested
- Memory leaks are prevented

## Contributing to Tests

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow the existing file structure and naming conventions
2. Include unit, integration, and accessibility tests for new features
3. Update mock data generators as needed
4. Ensure test coverage meets the required thresholds

### Test Writing Guidelines
1. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure tests clearly
2. **Descriptive Names**: Test names should explain the scenario
3. **Mock Isolation**: Use appropriate mocking strategies
4. **Error Testing**: Include both success and failure scenarios
5. **Accessibility**: Every UI change should include a11y tests

### Mock Data Updates
When adding new branch properties or API endpoints:
1. Update `branchMockData.ts` generators
2. Update `branchMockApi.ts` handlers
3. Update type definitions if needed
4. Add new test scenarios for the changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tests failing with "Network Error"**
- Check MSW server is properly initialized
- Verify API endpoint URLs in mock handlers
- Ensure mock data is properly seeded

**Component tests failing to render**
- Verify all required providers are wrapped around components
- Check for missing context providers
- Ensure mock implementations match expected interfaces

**Accessibility tests failing**
- Run individual accessibility tests to identify specific violations
- Use browser dev tools to inspect accessibility tree
- Verify ARIA attributes and semantic markup

**Integration tests timing out**
- Increase test timeout for complex workflows
- Check for unresolved promises or missing awaits
- Verify mock API responses are properly configured

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode for detailed test output:
```bash
npm run test -- --reporter=verbose
```
