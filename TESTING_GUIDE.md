## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Authentication Errors
```
❌ Expected success but got 401: {"success":false,"error":"Authentication required"}
```
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure TEST_TOKEN environment variable is set
2. Verify token is valid (not expired)
3. Test token manually with a simple API call

**Getting a Test Token**:
```bash
# Login via API to get token
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@example.com","password":"yourpassword"}'

# Extract token from response and export
export TEST_TOKEN="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
```

#### Permission Errors
```
❌ Expected success but got 403: {"success":false,"error":"Insufficient permissions"}
```
**Solution**:
1. Ensure test user has appropriate role (admin/manager)
2. Financial and staff reports require admin privileges
3. Use a user with proper permissions for testing

#### Connection Errors  
```
❌ fetch failed
```
**Solution**:
1. Verify backend server is running
2. Check API_BASE_URL is correct
3. Ensure no firewall blocking connections
4. Test basic connectivity: `curl http://localhost:3001/api/health`

#### Email Service Errors
```
❌ Email service not configured (expected in test environment)
```
**Solution**: This is normal if SMTP is not configured. Tests pass with this message.

#### Performance Test Failures
**Solutions**:
1. Ensure no other resource-intensive processes running
2. Check database performance and connections
3. Verify adequate system resources (CPU, RAM)
4. Consider adjusting performance thresholds if needed

### Environment Validation

```bash
# Check environment setup
npm run validate-env

# Expected output:
# TEST_TOKEN: Set
# API_BASE_URL: http://localhost:3001/api (or default)
# TEST_EMAIL: your-email@example.com (or default)
```

### Log Analysis

If tests fail, check the detailed logs:
1. Console output for immediate error details
2. `test-results/` directory for detailed JSON results
3. Individual test suite result files
4. Backend server logs for API-related issues
